What is SymPy
--------------

SymPy is a computer algebra system (CAS) written in the Python programming language. SymPy's features include:

- Arbitrary precision integers, rationals and floats, as well as symbolic expressions
- Simplification (e.g. ( abb + 2bab ) → (3ab^2)), expansion (e.g. ((a+b)^2) → (a^2 + 2ab + b^2)), and other methods of rewriting expressions
- Functions (exp, log, sin, ...)
- Complex numbers (like exp(I*x).expand(complex=True) → cos(x)+I*sin(x))
- Taylor (Laurent) series and limits
- Differentiation and integration
