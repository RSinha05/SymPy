Guide to symbolic mathematics
=============================

This is a tutorial about `SymPy <http://www.sympy.org>`_ that was originally prepared
for SciPy 2011 conferences (`Austin <http://conference.scipy.org/scipy2011/>`_ and
`Mumbai <http://scipy.in/scipyin/2011/>`_).

SymPy is a symbolic mathematics library in pure Python. This tutorial gives an overview
and introduction to SymPy and is divided into two parts. The first part discusses the
internals of SymPy, whereas the second part shows how to use SymPy for solving practical
problems in symbolic mathematics.

Information presented in this tutorial should be enough to start using SymPy in daily
work and hacking its internals, though hacking core modules may require additional
expertise. More information can be found in SymPy's `documentation <http://docs.sympy.org>`_
and on `wiki <http://wiki.sympy.org>`_ pages.
