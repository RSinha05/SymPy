History of SymPy and a few statistics
=====================================

SymPy was started in August 2006 by Ondrej Certik. Since then, a toy like
project grew considerably and many people contributed to it. As of beginning
of early 2013 there have been over 250 people who contributed at least
one commit to SymPy (see ``AUTHORS`` file in SymPy's source code repository
for details). SymPy itself consists of over 200k lines of code spread across
30+ modules. The source code revision history of SymPy contains more than 13000
commits. See http://www.ohloh.net/p/sympy for details.

Since 2007 SymPy has participated in Google Summer of Code. This program has
been a great opportunity for the project to get massive development over summers.
During six years of participation in the program there were 30 students working
on different aspects of SymPy:

+----------+------+------+------+------+------+------+
| Year     | 2007 | 2008 | 2009 | 2010 | 2011 | 2012 |
+==========+======+======+======+======+======+======+
| Students | 5    | 1    | 4    | 5    | 9    | 6    |
+----------+------+------+------+------+------+------+

All but one of these were successful. In 2011 SymPy was for the first time
a mentoring organization. In the previous years SymPy participated under
the umbrella of Python Software Foundation, Portland State University and
Space Telescope Science Institute. Both authors of this tutorials were
GSoC students at some point, Mateusz in 2007 and Aaron in 2009 and 2010.

SymPy also has participated in Google's programs for precollege students:
Highly Open Participation Contest in 2008 and Code--In in 2011, having
often excellent contributions from young (13-17 years old) participants.
