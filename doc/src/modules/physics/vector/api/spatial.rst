Spatial Vector Functions (Docstrings)
=====================================

These functions implement basic spatial vector operations. It should be noted
that there is not currently a spatial vector object and these functions all
operate on matrices. These functions are useful anywhere spatial vectors may be
used such as Featherstone's articulated body algorith of equations of motion
formation.

Spatial Rotation Matrices
=========================

.. autofunction:: sympy.physics.vector.spatial.rot

.. autofunction:: sympy.physics.vector.spatial.xlt

Spatial Cross Products
======================

.. autofunction:: sympy.physics.vector.spatial.cross_m

.. autofunction:: sympy.physics.vector.spatial.cross_f
