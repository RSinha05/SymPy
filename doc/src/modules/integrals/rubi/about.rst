About Rule Based Integrator
===========================

About it
--------

A RUle Based Integrator nicknamed Rubi is module in sympy.integrals. It is an
implementation of more than 6000 rules to cover a wide variety of indefinite
integration. Rubi utilizes a set of well defined rules which makes it smart to
present the results in a more symmetric and simplified manner. The Pattern 
Matcher (MatchPy) along with transformation rules plays an important role in 
making Rubi more robust and fast. As it works on the given set of rules. 
MatchPy is a pattern matching library in Python which has matching 
capabilities similar to Mathematica. But because MatchPy is only implemented 
in Python3.6 so Rubi is not supported by Python versions less than 3.6.
