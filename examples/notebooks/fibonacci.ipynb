    "# The Rabbits Problem\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the book \"Liber Abaci\" Leonardo of Pisa stated the following problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the set of rabbits satisfying following conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Rabbits are able to mate at the age of one month.\n",
    "2. Mating always produces new pair of rabbits (one male, one female).\n",
    "3. Mature pair produces one new pair every month.\n",
    "4. Rabbits never die.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting from one pair of newborns, how many pairs will there be after one year?\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's solve it in several ways using SymPy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Restructuring the problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately SymPy doesn't know anything about rabbits, so we need to state the problem in more abstract way. Firstly let's compute first few values: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. In the first month we have only the initial pair of immature rabbits.\n",
    "2. In the second month initial pair is mature, but still hasn't given birth.\n",
    "3. In the third month initial pair gives birth and we have _two_ pairs now.\n",
    "4. After three months initial pair gives second birth, what makes _three_ pairs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's denote $F_n$ the number of pairs in $n$th month. We have $F_1=1$ and $F_2=1$. We can also see that $F_n=F_{n-1}+F_{n-2}$. This holds because in $n$th month we have all pairs from $(n-1)$th month, and every pair which is more than one month old (i.e. that which was alive in $(n-2)$th month) gives one extra pair. Let's also denote $F_0=0$ so that the reccurence relation holds for $n\\geq 2$. Now we have more _mathematical_ notation for this problem, and the task is just to compute $F_{12}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The most straightforward way\n",
    "\n",
    "You have probably noticed that this is just the well-known [Fibonacci Sequence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number). So let's ask SymPy about the $12$th Fibonacci number:"
