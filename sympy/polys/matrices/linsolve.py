# sympy.polys.matrices.linsolve module
#
# This module defines the _linsolve function which is the internal workhorse
# used by linsolve. This computes the solution of a system of linear equations
# using the SDM sparse matrix implementation in sympy.polys.matrices.sdm. This
# is a replacement for solve_lin_sys in sympy.polys.solvers which is
# inefficient for large sparse systems due to the use of a PolyRing with many
# generators:
#
#     https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/20857
#
# The implementation of _linsolve here handles:
#
# - Extracting the coefficients from the Expr/Eq input equations.
# - Constructing a domain and converting the coefficients to
#   that domain.
# - Using the SDM.rref, SDM.nullspace etc methods to generate the full
#   solution working with arithmetic only in the domain of the coefficients.
#
# The routines here are particularly designed to be efficient for large sparse
# systems of linear equations although as well as dense systems. It is
# possible that for some small dense systems solve_lin_sys which uses the
# dense matrix implementation DDM will be more efficient. With smaller systems
# though the bulk of the time is spent just preprocessing the inputs and the
# relative time spent in rref is too small to be noticeable.

    Use results with caution if the equation was not fully expanded since
    the coefficients may contain expressions that would simplify to 0.
    For example, the following does not depend on ``x`` or ``y``:

    >>> _lin_eq2dict(x*(y + 1)*(y - 1) - x*y**2 + x + 2, {x})
    (2, {x: -y**2 + (y - 1)*(y + 1) + 1})

    The following does not raise an error because ``x**2`` does not appear in
    ``x``:

    >>> strict = True
    >>> _lin_eq2dict(x*(x**2 + 1), {x**2}, strict)
    (x, {x**2: x})

    But the reverse raises an error because ``x`` is in ``x**2``; the
    error is suppressed by using ``strict=False`. This might
    be most useful when wanting to allow ``f(x)`` and ``f(x).diff()`` to be
    treated as independent of each other.
