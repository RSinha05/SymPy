def lagrange_inversion_theorem(eq, x, a=0, n=3):

    The Lagrange inversion theorem (or Lagrange inversion formula, which we abbreviate
    as LIT), also known as the Lagrange--Bürmann formula, gives the Taylor series
    expansion of the inverse function of an analytic function.

    The theorem was proved by Lagrange (1736--1813) and generalized by the German
    mathematician and teacher Hans Heinrich Bürmann ( --1817), both in the late 18th
    century.

    The Lagrange inversion formula is one of the fundamental formulas of combinatorics.
    In its simplest form it gives a formula for the power series coefficients of the
    solution f(x) of the function equation f(x) = xG(f(x)) in terms of coefficients of
    powers of G.

    Theorem: Suppose z is defined as a function of w by an equation of the form

    f(w) = z

    where f is analytic at a point a and f'(a) is not equal to 0.
    Then it is possible to invert or solve the equation for w in the form of a series:

    . . math::
    g(z) = a + \sum_{n = 1}^{oo} \frac{g_n (z - f(a))^n}{/n!}

    where
                      n-1
                    d            w - a       n
    g_n =  lim   ( ------- (  -----------  )   )
          w-->a       n-1     f(w) - f(a)
                   dw

    The theorem further states that this series has a non-zero radius of convergence,
    i.e., w represents an analytic function of z in a neighbourhood of z = f(a).
    This is also called reversion of series.

    Parameters
    ==========

    eq : expression, the expansion of whose inverse is to be found.

    x : variable, in terms of which equation is given, and in terms of which, the
    expansion will be provided.

    a : point on x-axis in the neighbourhood of which, the inverse expansion is to be found.

    n : no of terms required in the expansion; default value is 3 terms.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.series.series import lagrange_inversion_theorem
    >>> from sympy import exp
    >>> from sympy.abc import x

    Let the equation whose inverse's expansion is to be found be y = f(x)
    then the first argument to be supplied must be f(x).
    Like here, the equation whose inverse's expansion to be found is y = (x**2)*exp(x)

    >>> eq = (x**2)*exp(x)

    Here the number of terms required in the expansion is provided.

    >>> lagrange_inversion_theorem(eq, x, 1, 4)
    -(x**2*exp(x) - E)**3*(-14*exp(3) - 14*E + 7 + 21*exp(2) + 7*exp(4))*exp(-4)/54 - 7*(x**2*exp(x) - E)**2*exp(-2)/54
    + (x**2*exp(x) - E)*exp(-1)/3 + 1

    Here the number of terms required is, by default, 3.

    >>> lagrange_inversion_theorem(eq, x, 1)
    -7*(x**2*exp(x) - E)**2*exp(-2)/54 + (x**2*exp(x) - E)*exp(-1)/3 + 1

    Here the point with respect to which the expansion is found is changed from x=1 to x=2.

    >>> lagrange_inversion_theorem(eq, x, 2)
    -7*(x**2*exp(x) - 4*exp(2))**2*exp(-4)/512 + (x**2*exp(x) - 4*exp(2))*exp(-2)/8 + 2

    >>> eq = exp(x)
    >>> lagrange_inversion_theorem(eq, x, 2)
    -(exp(x) - exp(2))**2*exp(-4)/2 + (exp(x) - exp(2))*exp(-2) + 2

    Here the number of terms and the point with respect to which the inverse expansion will be calculated are both
    not provided explicitly.

    >>> lagrange_inversion_theorem(eq, x)
    -(exp(x) - 1)**2/2 + exp(x) - 1

    Note
    ====

    There is a straightforward derivation using complex analysis and contour integration;
    the complex formal power series version is a consequence of knowing the formula for polynomials,
    so the theory of analytic functions may be applied. Actually, the machinery from analytic
    function theory enters only in a formal way in this proof, in that what is really needed is
    some property of the formal residue, and a more direct formal proof is available.
