        Explanation
        ===========
        The weights of an algebra, lambda, can be
        written as a linear combination of the simple roots, $\alpha_i$.
        The following theorem,

        .. math::
            a_i = 2\langle\lambda, \alpha_i \rangle / \langle\alpha_i, \alpha_i \rangle


        where $a_i$ are the Dynkin labels.  The fundamental weights
        of the algebra are the weights, lambda, with the smallest $a_i >= 0$.
        Note that if $\lambda_i==\alpha_i$, then the Dynkin labels become
        the elements of the Cartan matrix.
