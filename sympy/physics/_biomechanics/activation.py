"""Activation dynamics for musclotendon models.

Musculotendon models are able to produce active force when they are activated,
which is when a chemical process has taken place within the muscle fibers
causing them to voluntarily contract. Biologically this chemical process (the
diffusion of $Ca^{2+}$ ions) is not the input in the system, electrical signals
from the nervous system are. These are termed excitations. Activation dynamics,
which relates the normalized excitation level to the normalized activation
level, can be modeled by the models present in this module.

    $a0 = \frac{\tanh{\left(b \left(e - a\right) \right)}}{2}$
